# 🚀 React useEffect Hooks Practice Projects

A collection of React + useEffect practice projects with real-world APIs.
Each mini-project focuses on a specific concept like API fetching, debouncing, pagination, infinite scroll, polling, and device state detection.

# 1. Weather App 🌦
Scope:
 - Learn how to fetch dynamic API data using a query parameter (city name).
 - Practice loading state & error handling (Loading..., City not found).
 - Render dynamic UI (temperature, condition, icon).
 - Understand conditional rendering in React.

# 2. GitHub User Finder 🐙
Scope:
 - Fetch API data based on user input (username).
 - Handle valid vs invalid user responses (User not found).
 - Display user profile info (name, avatar, bio, followers).
 - Show GitHub repos and link them to external GitHub pages.
 - Learn dependency-based re-fetching → fetch again only when category (repos, followers, etc.) changes.
